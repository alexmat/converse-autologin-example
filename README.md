# converse-autologin-example

This is an example of an html page that can autologin to converse by storing the credentials in the users' browser local storage. I comes with a small plugin to be able to log out and remove any stored credentials by hooking into the converse logout button event.

*Please note that this is not a secure or recommended way of storing user credentials since they will be stored in plaintext on the user's machine!
